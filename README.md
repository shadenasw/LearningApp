# Learning App 📘

An intuitive, goal-setting app designed to help users stay consistent in their learning journey. Built with SwiftUI, the Learning App empowers users to set learning goals, track progress, and maintain streaks, with a “freeze” feature for days when taking a break is needed.

## Purpose 🎯

Learning App is designed to make learning a habit by helping users set, track, and maintain learning goals in a flexible and engaging way. With tools to log progress, manage streaks, and even “freeze” days, the app supports users’ learning journeys by keeping them organized and motivated.

## Why This Project is Useful 🌟

Learning App provides a structured way to develop and maintain learning habits over time. By visualizing progress, setting achievable goals, and tracking streaks, users can stay consistent and see their growth, making it ideal for both short-term skill acquisition and long-term learning commitments.
