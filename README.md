Learning App 📘

An intuitive, goal-setting app designed to help users stay consistent in their learning journey. Built with SwiftUI, the Learning app allows users to set learning goals, track their progress, and maintain streaks while offering features to “freeze” days when needed.

Features 🚀

	•	Set Learning Goals: Choose a subject or skill you want to focus on and set a custom learning goal.
	•	Track Your Progress: Use the interactive calendar to log your learning days, monitor streaks, and see when you’ve completed or missed a day.
	•	Streaks and Freezes: Keep your learning streak alive! Track how many consecutive days you’ve learned and freeze days when you can’t dedicate time to your goals.
	•	Customizable Durations: Choose your learning timeframe (week, month, or year) to align with your personal goals.
	•	Minimal and Dark UI: A clean, dark-themed interface that is easy on the eyes and keeps the focus on your goals.
